# I solved 1583 LeetCode problems. But you only need these 300.

Over the past six years, I’ve solved more than 1500 LeetCode problems.

But for a long time, I felt stuck.

I used to believe that simply solving more problems would automatically make me better at LeetCode. So, I kept grinding through problems, thinking that quantity alone would lead to mastery.

But despite my growing problem count, my problem-solving skills didn’t grow as much as I’d hoped.

Although solving more problems does help me in the beginning but most people spend too much time solving the wrong problems.

If your goal is to get better at LeetCode in short time, you should aim for quality problems and go deep into them rather than solving too many problems at a surface level.

Here are some tips that worked for me:

- Prioritize solving problems over theory.
- Visualize it using pen and paper.
- Understand, don’t memorize. Sit through a problem until you fully understand why a solution works.
- Learn the patterns behind problems.
- For every problem you solve, ask yourself: what is one thing knowing which made everything else easier?
- Revisit problems which you couldn’t solve in one go.
- Be consistent with your practice.

### So, how many problems one should solve?

The ideal number is subjective, but from experience, I’ve found that 300 well-chosen problems hit the sweet spot.

But it’s not just any 300 problems.

You should focus on high-quality problems that cover the most common patterns and problem types.

To make it easier for you, I created this free resource — a curated list of the top 300 LeetCode problems organized into 60 key topics and patterns. This list is designed to help you prepare smarter, not harder.

It covers all the essential patterns and problems you need to master to succeed in coding interviews.
